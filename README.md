Very basic timelock puzzle solver which is quite performant (thanks to the great MIRACL lib). 


This is a simple implementation of what is described here:
http://de.scribd.com/doc/32307363/Anti-Emulation-through-TimeLock-puzzles

Simply refer to that paper if you don't understand what the code does. 
You can create your own timelocks with 'makelock.py' which I included for your ease.

NOTE: To build this you'll need VS2013 or you will have to make changes to 'compile.cmd'
